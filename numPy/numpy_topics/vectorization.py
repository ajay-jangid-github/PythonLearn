# vectorization- without using loop, we will apply/perform operation to all in array.
# it is very fast- bcz this is use c language internally

import numpy as np 

a = np.array([1,2,3])
# b = np.array([4,5,6])
b = 3

# vectorized operation -- perform automatically operation, element by element
# print(a+b)
# print(b-a)

# broadcasting-- not match the array shape-  NumPy using broadcasting
